	<h3>Was the demise of the Bills all Rex's fault?</h3>
		<p>The long and short of it is that this was not entirely Rex's fault...<i>but for this sites purpose lets pretend it was</i></p>
		<p><strong>Rex </strong>was always known as a <i>defensive </i>guru dating back to his days as the <a href="http://www.baltimoreravens.com/">Baltimore Ravens </a>defensive coordinator</p>
		<p>He had consistantly good defences throughout his days as head coach of the <a href="http://www.newyorkjets.com/">New York Jets </a></p>

		<p>As you can see the defencive performances were consistantly good until Rex came to Buffalo</p>
		<p>Now from that chart alone you would think that the Bills were just a lousy team...<strong>BUT </strong>they in fact were not...they were ranked as the <strong>4th </strong>best defence in 2014 a year before Rex arrived</p>
		<p>So who do we have to blame for the decline......</p>
