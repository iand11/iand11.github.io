            <p><strong>Rex </strong>was always known as a <i>defensive </i>guru

            <p>he had consistantly good defences throughout his days as head coach of the <a href="http://www.newyorkjets.com/" target="_blank">New York Jets </a></p>

            <p>As you can see the defencive performances were consistantly good until Rex came to Buffalo</p>
            <p>Now from that chart alone you would think that the Bills were just a lousy team...<strong>BUT </strong></p>
            <p>they in fact were not...they were ranked as the <strong>4th </strong>best defence in 2014 a year before Rex arrived
